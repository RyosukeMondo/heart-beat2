  "content": "# Requirements Document\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis specification addresses a failing doctest in the `export_session` function that required the `tokio_test` crate dependency. The doctest provides example usage documentation for developers and must compile and run successfully as part of the test suite. The fix ensures all doctests pass without introducing unnecessary dependencies.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis aligns with the product quality standards by ensuring:\n- **80% test coverage minimum** (product.md requirement) - doctests contribute to overall test coverage\n- **CI/CD quality gates** - all tests must pass before merge\n- **Documentation quality** - doctests serve as executable documentation for API usage\n- **Minimal dependencies** - avoiding unnecessary dependencies reduces maintenance burden and build times\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want all doctests to compile and pass, so that the codebase maintains high quality standards and executable documentation.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN running `cargo test --doc` THEN the `export_session` doctest SHALL compile successfully\n2. WHEN running `cargo test --doc` THEN the `export_session` doctest SHALL execute without errors\n3. WHEN building the project THEN no new dev-dependencies SHALL be added to Cargo.toml\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent async testing patterns in doctests, so that the codebase is maintainable and predictable.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN reviewing async function doctests THEN they SHALL use a consistent approach for handling async execution\n2. IF a doctest needs to run async code THEN it SHALL use `tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on()` pattern\n3. WHEN all doctests are reviewed THEN no similar tokio_test dependency issues SHALL exist\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The fix should only address the doctest compilation issue\n- **Modular Design**: Solution should not introduce tight coupling to external test frameworks\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize project dependencies by using built-in tokio runtime instead of tokio_test\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Doctest examples should demonstrate clear, idiomatic usage patterns\n\n### Performance\n- Doctest execution time should remain minimal (< 2 seconds for all doctests)\n- Build time should not increase due to additional dependencies\n\n### Security\n- No security implications for this fix (doctest-only change)\n\n### Reliability\n- All doctests must pass consistently in CI/CD pipeline\n- Fix must not introduce flaky test behavior\n- Solution must work across all supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n\n### Usability\n- Doctest examples should remain clear and easy to understand for developers\n- Documentation should accurately reflect actual API usage patterns\n- Error messages from failing doctests should be informative\n",
