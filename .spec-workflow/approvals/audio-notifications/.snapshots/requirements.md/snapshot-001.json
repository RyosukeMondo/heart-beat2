This feature enhances the biofeedback loop by allowing users to adjust their intensity without constantly checking their phone screen.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nFrom product.md: \"Biofeedback Loop: Audio/visual notifications when heart rate deviates from target zone\" is listed as a key feature. This directly supports the product objective of \"Real-time biofeedback to help users maintain target heart rate zones during exercise\" and addresses the pain point of \"Lack of real-time guidance for maintaining target heart rate zones.\"\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Zone Deviation Audio Alerts\n\n**User Story:** As an athlete, I want to hear distinct sounds when my heart rate goes above or below my target zone, so that I can adjust my intensity without looking at my phone.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN heart rate exceeds target zone upper bound THEN system SHALL play \"too high\" audio notification\n2. WHEN heart rate falls below target zone lower bound THEN system SHALL play \"too low\" audio notification\n3. IF zone deviation occurs THEN system SHALL debounce audio alerts to prevent spam (minimum 5 second interval)\n4. WHEN returning to target zone THEN system SHALL stop playing deviation alerts\n\n### Requirement 2: Phase Transition Audio Alerts\n\n**User Story:** As an athlete, I want to hear a sound when my workout transitions to a new phase, so that I know when to change my intensity level.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN workout phase changes (WarmUp → Work, Work → Recovery, etc.) THEN system SHALL play phase transition audio\n2. IF phase transition occurs THEN audio SHALL be distinct from zone deviation alerts\n3. WHEN phase change audio plays THEN it SHALL not interfere with zone deviation alerts\n\n### Requirement 3: Audio Settings and Preferences\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to control audio feedback settings, so that I can customize notifications to my preferences.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user opens settings THEN system SHALL provide audio feedback enable/disable toggle\n2. IF audio feedback is disabled THEN system SHALL not play any audio notifications\n3. WHEN user adjusts volume THEN system SHALL provide volume control (0.0-1.0 scale)\n4. IF settings are changed THEN system SHALL persist preferences in UserProfile\n5. WHEN app restarts THEN system SHALL restore audio settings from UserProfile\n\n### Requirement 4: Background Audio Playback\n\n**User Story:** As an athlete, I want audio notifications to work even when my phone screen is off, so that I can conserve battery during workouts.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN workout is running in foreground service THEN audio notifications SHALL continue playing\n2. IF screen is locked THEN audio SHALL still play through phone speaker\n3. WHEN audio plays THEN system SHALL handle audio focus appropriately\n4. IF other audio is playing THEN system SHALL duck or pause according to Android audio focus policy\n\n### Requirement 5: Audio Asset Management\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want audio assets properly bundled and loaded, so that notifications play reliably without loading delays.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN app starts THEN audio assets SHALL be pre-loaded into memory\n2. IF audio file is missing THEN system SHALL log error and gracefully degrade\n3. WHEN audio plays THEN latency SHALL be < 100ms from trigger to sound\n4. IF multiple audio events occur THEN system SHALL queue or cancel appropriately\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: AudioFeedbackService handles only audio playback logic, separate from zone monitoring\n- **Modular Design**: Audio service as singleton with clear play/stop interface\n- **Dependency Management**: Audio package selection minimizes footprint and conflicts\n- **Clear Interfaces**: AudioFeedbackService exposes simple methods (playZoneTooHigh, playZoneTooLow, playPhaseTransition)\n\n### Performance\n- Audio playback must not block UI thread\n- Audio trigger latency < 100ms (aligned with product.md P95 latency goal)\n- Audio files kept small (< 100KB each) for fast loading\n- Debouncing prevents excessive audio alerts during zone boundary oscillation\n\n### Reliability\n- Audio must work during foreground service (screen off)\n- Handle audio focus conflicts with other apps gracefully\n- Degrade gracefully if audio service is unavailable\n- Settings persistence survives app restarts\n\n### Usability\n- Audio alerts must be distinct and easily distinguishable\n- Sounds should be non-intrusive and appropriate for exercise context\n- Volume levels reasonable for typical workout environments\n- Default settings enable audio with moderate volume (0.7)\n\n### Security\n- No sensitive data in audio asset paths or metadata\n- Audio settings do not expose system vulnerabilities\n\n### Battery Impact\n- Audio playback must be battery-efficient\n- No continuous polling for audio events\n- Release audio resources when not in active workout\n",
