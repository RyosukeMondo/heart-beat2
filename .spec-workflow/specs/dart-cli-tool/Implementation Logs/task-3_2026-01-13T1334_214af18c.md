### Functions

#### handleConnectCommand
- **Purpose:** Connect to BLE device and stream HR data to stdout with formatted table output
- **Location:** bin/dart_cli.dart:305
- **Signature:** Future<void> handleConnectCommand(String deviceId)
- **Exported:** No

### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Connect command uses Rust bridge APIs to connect to BLE devices and stream heart rate data
- **Frontend Component:** handleConnectCommand
- **Backend Endpoint:** connectDevice, createHrStream, hrRawBpm, hrFilteredBpm, disconnect
- **Data Flow:** User provides device ID → connectDevice establishes BLE connection → createHrStream opens heart rate data stream → For each HR event: extract raw and filtered BPM values → Display in formatted table → On Ctrl+C: gracefully disconnect
