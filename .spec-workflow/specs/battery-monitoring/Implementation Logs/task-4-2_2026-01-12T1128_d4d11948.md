### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Complete battery monitoring system verified from BLE device to Flutter UI
- **Frontend Component:** SessionScreen with BatteryIndicator widget
- **Backend Endpoint:** BtleplugAdapter.start_battery_polling() → create_battery_stream() API
- **Data Flow:** BLE Battery Service (0x180F) → 60s polling loop → Battery channel → Flutter StreamBuilder → UI display. Low battery (<15%) triggers notification via NotificationPort
