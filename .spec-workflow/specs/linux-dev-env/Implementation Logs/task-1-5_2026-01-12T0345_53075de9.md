## Artifacts

### Functions

#### BLE CLI Scan Test
- **Purpose:** Validated BLE scanning functionality via CLI to confirm hardware and software stack operational
- **Location:** rust/cli/src/main.rs (devices scan command)
- **Signature:** cargo run --bin cli -- devices scan -v
- **Exported:** No

### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Verified complete BLE stack integration on Linux from hardware to application layer
- **Frontend Component:** Flutter Linux App (HomeScreen)
- **Backend Endpoint:** Rust btleplug → BlueZ → Bluetooth Hardware
- **Data Flow:** User clicks Scan → Flutter UI → Rust scanDevices() → btleplug adapter → BlueZ D-Bus → Bluetooth Controller → Coospo HW9 device discovered
