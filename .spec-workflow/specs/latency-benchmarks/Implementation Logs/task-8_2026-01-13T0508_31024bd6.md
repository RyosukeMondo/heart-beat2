## Artifacts

### Components

#### LATENCY.md
- **Type:** Documentation
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive latency documentation covering requirements, budget allocation, measurement methodology, benchmarking, and debugging guidance
- **Location:** docs/LATENCY.md
- **Exports:** Latency requirements, Budget allocation table, Measurement methodology, Data flow diagram, Benchmark usage guide, Debugging procedures, Production monitoring examples

### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Documentation ties together all latency measurement components: BLE timestamp capture (btleplug_adapter.rs:665), Rust processing (api.rs), FRB bridge, and Flutter UI updates with percentile calculation examples
- **Frontend Component:** Flutter LatencyMonitor class (example provided)
- **Backend Endpoint:** FilteredHeartRate.receive_timestamp_micros field
- **Data Flow:** BLE notification → Instant::now() capture → propagate through pipeline → Flutter DateTime.now() comparison → P50/P95/P99 calculation → logging/alerting
