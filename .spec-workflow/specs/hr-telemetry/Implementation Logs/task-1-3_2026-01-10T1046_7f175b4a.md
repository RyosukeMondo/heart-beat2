## Artifacts

### Components

#### DiscoveredDevice
- **Type:** Rust struct
- **Purpose:** Represents a BLE device discovered during scanning operations with device ID, name (optional), and signal strength
- **Location:** rust/src/domain/heart_rate.rs:80-96
- **Props:** id: String, name: Option<String>, rssi: i16
- **Exports:** DiscoveredDevice (pub)

#### FilteredHeartRate
- **Type:** Rust struct
- **Purpose:** Final processed heart rate output containing raw and filtered BPM, HRV metrics, battery level, and timestamp for FRB transmission
- **Location:** rust/src/domain/heart_rate.rs:104-132
- **Props:** raw_bpm: u16, filtered_bpm: u16, rmssd: Option<f64>, battery_level: Option<u8>, timestamp: u64
- **Exports:** FilteredHeartRate (pub)
