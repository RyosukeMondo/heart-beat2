## Artifacts

### Classes

#### BleAdapter
- **Purpose:** Async trait that abstracts BLE operations for testability and swappability, enabling both real hardware and mock implementations
- **Location:** rust/src/ports/ble_adapter.rs:18
- **Methods:** start_scan() -> Result<()>, stop_scan() -> Result<()>, get_discovered_devices() -> Vec<DiscoveredDevice>, connect(device_id: &str) -> Result<()>, disconnect() -> Result<()>, subscribe_hr() -> Result<Receiver<Vec<u8>>>, read_battery() -> Result<u8>
- **Exported:** Yes

### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** BleAdapter trait uses tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver for async channel communication, enabling real-time streaming of heart rate data from BLE notifications
- **Frontend Component:** BleAdapter::subscribe_hr
- **Backend Endpoint:** Returns Receiver<Vec<u8>> for BLE notification stream
- **Data Flow:** BLE notifications → subscribe_hr() → Receiver<Vec<u8>> → consumer (state machine or CLI)
