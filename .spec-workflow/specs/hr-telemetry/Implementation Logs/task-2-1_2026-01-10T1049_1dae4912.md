## Artifacts

### Functions

#### parse_heart_rate
- **Purpose:** Parse BLE Heart Rate Measurement characteristic (UUID 0x2A37) per Bluetooth SIG specification into HeartRateMeasurement struct
- **Location:** rust/src/domain/heart_rate.rs:169-235
- **Signature:** pub fn parse_heart_rate(data: &[u8]) -> anyhow::Result<HeartRateMeasurement>
- **Exported:** Yes

### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** parse_heart_rate function integrates with HeartRateMeasurement domain type
- **Frontend Component:** N/A (pure domain function)
- **Backend Endpoint:** Will be called by BLE adapter when HR notifications arrive
- **Data Flow:** BLE notification bytes → parse_heart_rate → HeartRateMeasurement → Kalman filter → HRV calculator → FilteredHeartRate output
