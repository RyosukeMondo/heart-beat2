### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Integration tests verify the complete BLE connection flow from app launch through device scanning, permission handling, device selection, and connection establishment to session screen
- **Frontend Component:** HomeScreen + SessionScreen
- **Backend Endpoint:** Rust BLE APIs: scanDevices(), connect()
- **Data Flow:** User taps Scan -> Request BLE permissions -> Call scanDevices() -> Display device list -> User taps device -> Navigate to SessionScreen -> Establish connection -> Display HR stream
