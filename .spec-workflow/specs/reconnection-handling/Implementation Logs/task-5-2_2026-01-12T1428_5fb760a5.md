### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Manual testing validated the full reconnection flow from UI through Rust domain to BLE adapter
- **Frontend Component:** ConnectionBanner widget on session_screen.dart and workout_screen.dart
- **Backend Endpoint:** connection_status_stream from api.rs
- **Data Flow:** User triggers disconnect → BtleplugAdapter detects disconnect → ConnectionStatus::Reconnecting emitted → ConnectionBanner displays attempt count → SessionExecutor pauses session → Exponential backoff delays retry → Successful reconnect → ConnectionStatus::Connected emitted → SessionExecutor resumes session → ConnectionBanner hides
