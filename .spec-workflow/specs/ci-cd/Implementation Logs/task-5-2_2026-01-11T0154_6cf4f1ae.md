### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** GitHub Actions workflow triggered on pull requests that compares benchmark performance between main and PR branches using criterion's baseline comparison feature
- **Frontend Component:** GitHub Actions workflow
- **Backend Endpoint:** N/A - CI/CD workflow
- **Data Flow:** PR created → Workflow triggered → Checkout main → Run benchmarks (save baseline) → Checkout PR → Run benchmarks (compare to baseline) → Parse criterion output → Generate report → Comment on PR → Fail if >10% regression in full_pipeline
