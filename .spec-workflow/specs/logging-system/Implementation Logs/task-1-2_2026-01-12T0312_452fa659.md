### Functions

#### init_logging
- **Purpose:** Initialize logging with dual output on Android: both FlutterLogWriter for Flutter stream and android_logger for logcat
- **Location:** rust/src/api.rs:258-305
- **Signature:** pub fn init_logging(sink: StreamSink<LogMessage>) -> Result<()>
- **Exported:** Yes

### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** On Android, init_logging now initializes both FlutterLogWriter (for Flutter stream) and android_logger (for logcat). The log level from RUST_LOG env var is parsed and applied to both outputs.
- **Frontend Component:** Flutter app (via init_logging call in main.dart)
- **Backend Endpoint:** init_logging FFI function
- **Data Flow:** init_logging called → Store StreamSink globally → Parse RUST_LOG env var → Initialize android_logger with same log level (Android only) → Set up tracing subscriber with FlutterLogWriter → Logs flow to both Flutter stream and logcat on Android
