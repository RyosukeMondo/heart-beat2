///
/// **IMPORTANT**: This function should be called once during Flutter app initialization,
/// before making any other FFI calls to Rust.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// In your Flutter/Dart code:
/// ```dart
/// void main() async {
///   // Initialize Rust panic handler first
///   await RustLib.init();
///   initPanicHandler();
///
///   runApp(MyApp());

/// # Errors
///
/// On Android: Returns an error if btleplug platform initialization fails (e.g., missing
