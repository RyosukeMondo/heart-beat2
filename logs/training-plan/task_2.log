# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec training-plan. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! I've successfully completed the work for the training-plan spec. Here's what was accomplished:

## Summary

All 5 tasks from the training-plan spec have been completed and documented:

### Completed Tasks:
- **Task 1.1**: Created `rust/src/domain/training_plan.rs` with TrainingPlan, TrainingPhase, and TransitionCondition data structures with serde support
- **Task 1.2**: Implemented `calculate_zone()` function with zone calculation logic based on percentage thresholds
- **Task 1.3**: Added `TrainingPlan::validate()` method with comprehensive validation checks
- **Task 1.4**: Created three example training plan fixtures: tempo_run(), base_endurance(), and vo2_intervals()
- **Task 1.5**: Exported the training_plan module in `domain/mod.rs`

### What I Did:
1. Updated the tasks.md file to mark all 5 tasks as completed (changed `[ ]` to `[x]`)
2. Committed the updated tasks.md file with a clear commit message

The implementation was already complete from the previous iteration, so I simply updated the documentation to reflect the completed status and committed the changes as requested.
