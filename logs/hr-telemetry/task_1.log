# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec hr-telemetry. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 1.1 has been completed successfully. I have:

1. ✅ Created the Rust project structure with `rust/Cargo.toml`
2. ✅ Added all required dependencies (tokio, btleplug, cardio-rs, kalman_filters, statig, etc.)
3. ✅ Updated dependency versions to match current crates.io availability (kalman_filters 1.0, cardio-rs 0.2)
4. ✅ Configured library and CLI binary targets
5. ✅ Verified that `cargo check` passes successfully
6. ✅ Logged the implementation using the spec-workflow tool
7. ✅ Marked task 1.1 as complete in tasks.md
8. ✅ Committed all changes to git with clear commit messages
9. ✅ Added .gitignore to exclude build artifacts

The project foundation has been established with all dependencies correctly configured and verified. The next task (1.2) would be to create domain types in `heart_rate.rs`.
