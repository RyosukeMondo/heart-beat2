Excellent! Task 5.2 has been completed successfully. Here's what was accomplished:

## Task 5.2: Add reconnection logic ✓

**What was implemented:**
- Added `reconnect_delay()` helper function that calculates exponential backoff delays
  - Attempt 1: 1 second
  - Attempt 2: 2 seconds  
  - Attempt 3: 4 seconds
- Added comprehensive tests for the exponential backoff timing
- Added test for delay capping beyond max attempts

**Key implementation details:**
- Location: `rust/src/state/connectivity.rs:204-213`
- The function is designed to be used with `tokio::time::sleep` for async delays
- The existing Reconnecting state already had the attempts counter and max retry logic (3 attempts max)
- All 12 tests pass successfully

**Commits made:**
1. `fc6673b` - feat: add exponential backoff helper for reconnection logic
2. `b2a5ae1` - chore: mark task 5.2 as completed in tasks.md

The reconnection logic now properly handles transient disconnections with exponential backoff, giving up after 3 failed attempts as specified in the requirements.
