# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec hr-telemetry. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 1.2 has been completed successfully. I have:

1. ✅ Created `rust/src/domain/heart_rate.rs` with:
   - `Zone` enum representing 5 heart rate training zones
   - `HeartRateMeasurement` struct with BPM, RR-intervals, and sensor contact fields
   - `Display` trait implementations for both types
   - Comprehensive unit tests

2. ✅ Created `rust/src/domain/mod.rs` to expose the domain module with re-exports

3. ✅ Updated `rust/src/lib.rs` to include the domain module

4. ✅ Verified compilation with `cargo check` - all code compiles successfully

5. ✅ Ran tests with `cargo test` - all 3 new tests pass

6. ✅ Logged implementation details using the log-implementation tool

7. ✅ Committed changes with a clear, descriptive commit message

The domain types follow the hexagonal architecture principles with no I/O dependencies, exactly as specified in the design document. Ready for the next task!
