# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec hr-telemetry. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 3.3 has been completed successfully. I've implemented:

1. **`is_valid_bpm()` function** - Validates heart rate measurements are within the physiologically plausible range of 30-220 BPM, covering:
   - Athletic resting heart rates (~30 BPM)
   - Normal resting heart rates (60-80 BPM)
   - Exercise heart rates (up to ~220 BPM)

2. **`filter_if_valid()` method** - Extends the KalmanFilter to only update when measurements are valid. Invalid measurements are rejected and the filter state is preserved, preventing sensor artifacts from corrupting the filter.

3. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Added 12 new tests covering:
   - Normal, athletic, and exercise heart rate ranges
   - Boundary conditions (30 and 220 BPM)
   - Invalid low and high values
   - Filter behavior with valid/invalid measurements
   - State preservation across multiple invalid measurements

All 16 tests pass successfully. The implementation has been committed to git with a clear commit message.
