# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec hr-telemetry. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 7.1 has been completed successfully. I:

1. **Enhanced module organization** with comprehensive re-exports across all mod.rs files:
   - Updated `rust/src/lib.rs` with architecture documentation and Quick Start example
   - Enhanced `rust/src/domain/mod.rs` to re-export all public types and functions (is_valid_bpm, parse_heart_rate, DiscoveredDevice, FilteredHeartRate)
   - Enhanced `rust/src/state/mod.rs` to re-export ConnectionContext and reconnect_delay

2. **Verified compilation and documentation**:
   - All code compiles successfully (`cargo check`)
   - Documentation generates cleanly (`cargo doc`)
   - All 83 tests pass

3. **Committed the changes** with clear commit messages

4. **Logged the implementation** with detailed artifacts documentation

The module structure now follows structure.md exactly with clean API re-exports that make all key types accessible from the crate root while maintaining proper hexagonal architecture organization.
