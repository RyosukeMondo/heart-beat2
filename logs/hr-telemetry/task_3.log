# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec hr-telemetry. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 1.3 has been completed successfully. I've:

1. Added two new domain types to `rust/src/domain/heart_rate.rs:80-132`:
   - **DiscoveredDevice** - Represents BLE devices found during scanning with id, name (optional), and rssi fields
   - **FilteredHeartRate** - Final processed heart rate output containing raw_bpm, filtered_bpm, rmssd (HRV), battery_level, and timestamp

2. Both structs derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for Flutter Rust Bridge compatibility as required

3. The code compiles successfully with `cargo check`

4. Committed the changes with clear commit messages

5. Logged the implementation details for future reference

6. Marked task 1.3 as completed in the tasks.md file

The next task would be 2.1: Implement HR packet parser, but you asked me to work on a single task. Task 1.3 is now complete!
