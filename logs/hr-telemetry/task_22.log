# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec hr-telemetry. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! I've successfully completed task 8.3 for the hr-telemetry spec. Here's what was implemented:

## Completed: Task 8.3 - Add Coverage Enforcement

Created a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml:1` that includes:

### Quality Gates:
1. **Format checking** - Ensures code follows Rust formatting standards with `cargo fmt --check`
2. **Linting** - Runs `cargo clippy` with warnings treated as errors
3. **Testing** - Executes all unit and integration tests
4. **Coverage generation** - Uses `cargo-tarpaulin` to generate XML coverage reports
5. **Coverage enforcement** - Fails the build if coverage drops below 80%
6. **Codecov integration** - Uploads coverage reports for tracking over time

### Optimizations:
- Caches cargo registry, git index, and build artifacts for faster CI runs
- Installs required system dependencies (libudev-dev, libdbus-1-dev) for BLE support
- Runs on push to main and pull requests

The workflow has been committed to the repository. All 22 tasks in the hr-telemetry spec are now complete!
