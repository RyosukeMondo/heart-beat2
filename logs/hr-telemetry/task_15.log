# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec hr-telemetry. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 6.1 is complete and committed. The CLI binary structure is now in place with:

- ✅ Clap derive macros for argument parsing
- ✅ Three subcommands: `scan`, `connect <device-id>`, and `mock`
- ✅ Global `--verbose` flag for debug logging
- ✅ Tracing subscriber initialization with configurable log levels (INFO by default, DEBUG with --verbose)
- ✅ Help output displays correctly for all commands
- ✅ Arguments parse correctly
- ✅ Committed to git with a clear message

The CLI is ready for the subsequent tasks to implement the actual functionality for each subcommand.
