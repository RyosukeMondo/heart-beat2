# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec scheduler. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 1.3 is complete and committed. I have completed 3 out of 6 tasks for the scheduler spec:
- ✅ Task 1.1: Created scheduler module structure  
- ✅ Task 1.2: Implemented SessionExecutor::start_session
- ✅ Task 1.3: Integrated HR data stream

The remaining tasks are:
- Task 1.4: Add session persistence
- Task 1.5: Implement cron scheduling
- Task 1.6: Export scheduler in lib.rs

This represents significant progress on the scheduler spec. Each commit is atomic and focused on a single logical unit of work, with comprehensive tests and clear commit messages as requested.
