# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec scheduler. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 1.4 has been successfully completed and committed. The session persistence feature is now fully implemented with:

1. ✅ **Checkpoint structure** - `SessionCheckpoint` serializes plan, phase, elapsed time, and pause state
2. ✅ **Periodic saves** - Every 10 ticks (10 seconds) the session state is saved to disk
3. ✅ **Auto-load on startup** - `SessionExecutor::with_persistence()` loads existing checkpoints
4. ✅ **Automatic cleanup** - Checkpoint files are cleared when sessions complete
5. ✅ **Comprehensive tests** - 2 new tests verify save/load and cleanup behavior
6. ✅ **Dependencies added** - serde_json for serialization, tempfile for test isolation

All tests pass (5/5), and the implementation follows the spec requirements exactly. The scheduler can now survive process crashes without losing workout progress!

According to the log from task 1, the remaining tasks for the scheduler spec are:
- **Task 1.4**: ✅ Complete (just committed)
- **Task 1.5**: Implement cron scheduling 
- **Task 1.6**: Export scheduler in lib.rs

Task 1.4 (session persistence) has been successfully completed and committed!
